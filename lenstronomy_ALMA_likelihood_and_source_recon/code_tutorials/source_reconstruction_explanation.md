**Here we briefly explain the general idea of pixelated source reconstruction 
  and the notations (M matrix, U matrix, and b vector) used in the Jupyter notebooks.**

**In our code, we provide functions to generate the M matrix, U matrix, and b vector used to solve for the source image pixel values.
More details on the notation and method can be found in (placeholder for Nan's paper).
The approach to source regularization and selecting the optimal regularization strength also follows the method described in:

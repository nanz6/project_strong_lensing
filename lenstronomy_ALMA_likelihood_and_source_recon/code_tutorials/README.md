# Lens Modeling Examples

This folder contains two example files that demonstrate different aspects of lens modeling using `lenstronomy` introduced by the paper (placeholder). The examples focus on two distinct topics: **parametric modeling of ALMA interferometric images**, and **pixelated source reconstruction**.

##  Files Overview

### 1. <a href="https://github.com/nanz6/projects_of_strong_lensing/blob/main/lenstronomy_ALMA_likelihood_and_source_recon/code_tutorials/ALMA%20image%20parametric%20fitting.ipynb" target="_blank">ALMA image parametric fitting</a>
This notebook provides an example of fitting **simulated ALMA interferometric images** using parametric lens and source models in `lenstronomy`.


### 2. <a href="https://github.com/nanz6/projects_of_strong_lensing/blob/main/lenstronomy_ALMA_likelihood_and_source_recon/code_tutorials/Pixelated%20source%20reconstruction.ipynb" target="_blank">Pixelated source reconstruction</a>
This notebook walks through an example of performing **pixelated source reconstruction** from a lensed image using `lenstronomy`.
- This method is **general** and **not specific to ALMA data**.
- Additional explanation and mathematical background is introduced by <a href="https://github.com/nanz6/projects_of_strong_lensing/blob/main/lenstronomy_ALMA_likelihood_and_source_recon/code_tutorials/source_reconstruction_explanation.md" target="_blank">source_reconstruction_explanation</a>.

## Notes
- The ALMA fitting example and the pixelated source reconstruction are **separate pipelines**.
- You do **not** need to read one to understand the other.
- Both can be used as standalone templates depending on your scientific goals.

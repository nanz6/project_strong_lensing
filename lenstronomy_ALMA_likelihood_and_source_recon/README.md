# ALMA Fitting and Pixelated Source Reconstruction with Lenstronomy

This repository contains example notebooks and resources for performing pixelated source reconstruction and parametric modeling of ALMA interferometric images using [`lenstronomy`](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy). The examples are designed to help users understand and apply these techniques in their own work.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### `code_tutorials/`  
This is the **main part of the repository** and contains well-documented example notebooks:

- `ALMA image parametric fitting.ipynb`:  
  A complete example demonstrating how to fit simulated ALMA dirty images using a parametric lens model and the specialized interferometric likelihood in `lenstronomy`.

- `Pixelated source reconstruction.ipynb`:  
  A walkthrough of pixelated source reconstruction from a lensed image, including the setup of regularization and solving for the optimal regularization strength. Not specific to ALMA.

- `source_reconstruction_explanation.md`:  
  A companion file providing background and notations for the pixelated source reconstruction method.

These notebooks can be used as practical templates for lens modeling projects.


### `science_results/`  
This folder contains scripts and notebooks related to analysis of **SPT0346-52** and **SPT0311-58** of the paper (placeholder). These are provided as reference materials.
